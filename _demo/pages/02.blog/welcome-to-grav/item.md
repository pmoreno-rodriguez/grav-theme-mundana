Grav is a Fast, Simple, and Flexible file-based Web-platform. There is Zero installation required. Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running. Although Grav follows principles similar to other flat-file CMS platforms, it has a different design philosophy than most.

The name Grav is just a shortened version of the word Gravity. The shared namespace of our platform and a movie starring Sandra Bullock is pure coincidence! More importantly, gravity is also a fundamental physical principle that describes the forces of attraction between objects. Frankly, the name was chosen as a temporary "codename" for the project, and it just stuck.

The underlying architecture of Grav is built using well established and best-in-class technologies. This is to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include:

*     Twig Templating: for powerful control of the user interface
*     Markdown: for easy content creation
*     YAML: for simple configuration
*     Parsedown: for fast Markdown and Markdown Extra support
*     Doctrine Cache: for performance
*     Pimple Dependency Injection Container: for extensibility and maintainability
*     Symfony Event Dispatcher: for plugin event handling
*     Symfony Console: for CLI interface
*     Gregwar Image Library: for dynamic image manipulation
